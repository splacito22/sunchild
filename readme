# Sunchild 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

​

## Description

This project is a Password Generator. A web application that allows users to generate random and secure passwords based on their selected criteria. It runs in the browser and features a clean and responsive user interface. This project was created as part of a coding challenge and showcases the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive web application. The password generator provides a convenient tool for users to create strong and secure passwords for their sensitive data.
​

## Tasks

Prompt the user to enter the desired password length (between 8 and 128 characters).
Validate the user input to ensure it is a valid integer within the specified range (8 to 128 characters).
Ask the user to confirm whether to include lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numeric characters using the confirm function.
Validate the user's selection to ensure at least one character type is chosen.
Generate a random password based on the user-selected criteria.
Build the character set for the password based on the selected character types.
Utilize a loop to randomly select characters from the character set to create the password.
Display the generated password in the designated text area for the user to view.
Create a clean and polished user interface with proper layout and styling using HTML and CSS.
Add event listeners to the "Generate Password" button to trigger the password generation process.
Test the application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected, handling edge cases and user input validation.
